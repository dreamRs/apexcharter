```{r, include = FALSE}

```

```{r setup}

data("economics", package = "ggplot2")
economics <- tail(economics, 150)
```


With [Apexcharts](https://apexcharts.com) you can sync (tooltip, zoom) several charts together by providing a group and id to each charts. This works in Shiny and Markdown. Here a basic example :

```{r example-1, eval=FALSE}
apex(
  data = economics, 
  mapping = aes(x = date, y = pce),
  type = "line"
) %>% 
  ax_stroke(width = 2) %>% 
  ax_chart(group = "economics", id = "pce")

apex(
  data = economics, 
  mapping = aes(x = date, y = psavert),
  type = "line"
) %>% 
  ax_stroke(width = 2) %>% 
  ax_chart(group = "economics", id = "psavert")
```


```{r run-example-1, echo=FALSE, ref.label="example-1"}

```
